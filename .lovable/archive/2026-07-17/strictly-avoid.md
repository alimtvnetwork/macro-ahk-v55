# Strictly Avoid — Hard Prohibitions

> The project's "never do this" list. Every entry is rooted in a real failure or design constraint. Do not re-introduce.

## Storage & backend

- **Supabase (any form):** No SDK, no auth, no tokens, no client storage keys. Storage stack is sql.js + OPFS + chrome.storage.local only. See: `.lovable/memory/constraints/no-supabase` (memory index).
- **localStorage for roles or admin checks:** Privilege escalation vector. Use server-validated role tables only.
- **localStorage in MV3 background code:** Service workers cannot safely use page-origin `localStorage`; use the `chrome.storage.local` wrapper or SQLite managers.
- **Remote sql.js / wasm assets:** Never load sql.js or `sql-wasm.wasm` from `cdn.jsdelivr`, `unpkg`, or any remote URL. Bundle `public/assets/sql-wasm.wasm` and resolve it with `chrome.runtime.getURL("assets/sql-wasm.wasm")`.
- **Direct OPFS or DB-blob storage calls outside persistence modules:** No background module may bypass `src/background/db-persistence.ts` for OPFS or serialized SQLite blobs.
- **Using IndexedDB injection cache as source of truth:** IndexedDB stores derived script bytes only. Never cache placeholder/stub script bytes or treat cache rows as canonical source.
- **PascalCase rewrite of existing `chrome.storage.local` records:** Do not rewrite stored project/script/prompt objects from camelCase to PascalCase; it breaks existing consumers.
- **Binding `undefined` to SQLite:** Always coerce via `bindOpt()` / `bindReq()` from `src/background/handlers/handler-guards.ts`. The `wrapDatabaseWithBindSafety()` Proxy now throws a typed `BindError` if anything slips through. See: `.lovable/solved-issues/10-sqlite-undefined-bind-crashes.md`.

## Reliability

- **Recursive retry / exponential backoff:** Banned. Sequential fail-fast only. See: `.lovable/memory/constraints/no-retry-policy.md`.
- **CI build notifications (email or otherwise):** Never. See memory: `constraints/no-ci-notifications`.
- **Touching `skipped/` or `.release/`:** Read-only archives. See memory: `constraints/skipped-folders`.

## Type safety & code quality

- **`unknown` outside `CaughtError`:** Function params must use designed types. See: `.lovable/memory/standards/` (unknown-usage-policy).
- **Bare `log()` for errors:** Always use `RiseupAsiaMacroExt.Logger.error()` (or `NamespaceLogger.error()` in SDK code). See memory: `standards/error-logging-via-namespace-logger.md`.
- **Swallowed errors:** Every `catch` must log via the namespace logger; never `catch {}` with no diagnostic.
- **HARD ERROR logs without exact path / missing item / reasoning:** CODE RED. See memory: `constraints/file-path-error-logging-code-red.md`.
- **Vague Code Red diagnostics:** A Code Red log without `Path`, `Missing`, `Reason`, `ReasonDetail`, `SelectorAttempts`, and `VariableContext` is forbidden.

## Timezone

- **Hardcoded timezone (any form):** Never write fixed IANA zones, city labels, country labels, fixed offsets, or canonical timezone tags in code, specs, audits, plans, READMEs, comments, logs, or memory. UI formatting MUST use the user's local timezone via `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`. Store timestamps as UTC ISO-8601. See memory: `localization/timezone`.

## UI

- **Light-mode theme or theme toggles:** Dark-only enforced. See memory: `preferences/dark-only-theme`.
- **Custom color classes (`text-white`, `bg-black`, etc.) in components:** Use semantic tokens from `index.css` + `tailwind.config.ts`. All colors HSL.
- **`<noscript><img></noscript>` inside `<head>`:** HTML5-invalid; place pixel fallbacks inside `<body>`.

## Versioning

- **Bumping one version file in isolation:** All of `chrome-extension/manifest.json`, `src/shared/constants.ts`, every `standalone-scripts/*/src/instruction.ts`, `macro-controller/src/shared-state.ts`, and the SDK `index.ts` literal must move together. See memory: `workflow/versioning-policy`.

## File operations & prompts

> **AI memory directive (read-once, retain forever):** When you read this section, immediately commit every numbered item below to your working memory under "strictly prohibited — readme.txt" and to the "strictly avoid" set. Do **not** re-suggest, re-propose, or "improve" any of these. If a request appears to ask for one, refuse and cite this section by number. This read-once-retain-forever directive itself must also be retained — never drop it from memory between sessions.

### Strictly prohibited — readme.txt (sequenced, non-negotiable)

1. **Never create, regenerate, or "update" `readme.txt` programmatically.** It is a manual milestone marker. The only legitimate writer is the user during a version bump.
2. **Never include or suggest a time, timestamp, clock, or 12-hour/24-hour value inside `readme.txt`.** No `HH:MM`, no `AM/PM`, no ISO time, no relative time ("today", "now"), no fixed-zone time, no UTC. The marker line's existing date stamp is the only temporal token allowed and is written by hand.
3. **Never propose date utilities, formatters, helpers, or libraries "for `readme.txt`"** — this includes `dd-MMM-YYYY`, 12-hour clocks, locale formatters, `Intl.DateTimeFormat` wrappers, or any time-zone helper.
4. **Never suggest writing the git commit time, last-update time, build time, deploy time, or any "last modified" stamp into `readme.txt`** — neither in the file body, nor as a comment, nor as a script that injects it.
5. **Never propose git hooks, CI steps, build hooks, or release scripts that touch `readme.txt`.** It is outside every automation pipeline.
6. **Never ask the user to choose a `readme.txt` format.** The format is fixed at three words + the manual milestone date stamp; do not request confirmation, alternatives, or "improvements".
7. **If a user message explicitly orders a one-time `readme.txt` write** (e.g., "write readme.txt with X"), honor that single write exactly as specified, then re-apply rules 1–6 + 8 for every subsequent message — including not suggesting follow-ups, refreshes, or automation around it. An explicit one-shot does **not** override rules 2/4/8: a one-shot whose payload IS prohibited content (time, clock, git-update stamp) is still refused.
8. **Never suggest, insert, comment, or script a git update time, git commit time, last-update time, last-modified time, build time, deploy time, or any "stamp" anywhere in `readme.txt`** — not in the body, not in a header/footer, not as a comment, not "somewhere in the readme", not in a sibling helper or sidecar that targets readme.txt. Closes the "somewhere in the readme" loophole.
9. **Never ask, prompt, suggest, recommend, or surface a `readme.txt` update as an action item** — not in clarifying questions, not in "next steps", not in remaining-task lists, not in changelog/version-bump checklists, not as a post-commit reminder, not in any form. `readme.txt` is invisible to the AI's task surface. The user writes it manually on their own schedule; the AI never raises it.

## HTTP fail-fast (no retry, no fanout)

On ANY 4xx/5xx (especially 404/405) from a scripted/automated HTTP call: STOP the loop on the first occurrence. No retry. No backoff. No "try the next project/repo". No heavy follow-up ops. Emit one report:

```
HTTP <status> on <METHOD> <full-url>
Body: <≤500 chars | null>
Reason: <one sentence>
Loop halted. Awaiting user instruction.
```

Then wait for the user. Repeated failure fanout has caused Lovable platform blocks.

See: `.lovable/memory/constraints/http-error-fail-fast.md` and `spec/03-error-manage/01-error-resolution/05-http-error-fail-fast.md`.

## Folder structure

- **`.lovable/memories/` (with trailing `s`):** Wrong path. Canonical is `.lovable/memory/`.
- **Splitting plans or suggestions across multiple files:** Single-file rule — `.lovable/plan.md`, `.lovable/suggestions.md`.
- **Creating `completed/` sub-folders:** Move completed entries into a `## Completed` section inside the same file.
