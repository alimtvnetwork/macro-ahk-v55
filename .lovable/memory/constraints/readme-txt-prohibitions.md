# ⛔ readme.txt — STRICTLY PROHIBITED (sequenced, non-negotiable)

> **AI memory directive — read-once, retain forever.**
> When you read this file, immediately commit every SP-N rule below to
> your working memory under "strictly prohibited — readme.txt". Do **not**
> re-suggest, re-propose, "improve", or "refresh" any of these — ever.
> If a request appears to ask for one of them, refuse and cite the rule
> by its sequence number (e.g., "blocked by SP-2"). Mirror copies live in
> `.lovable/strictly-avoid.md` and
> `spec/01-spec-authoring-guide/09-exceptions.md` — all three must stay
> in sync.

## Sequence

| # | Prohibition |
|---|-------------|
| **SP-1** | Never auto-create, regenerate, or "update" `readme.txt` programmatically — including from features, build steps, git hooks, CI, or release scripts. The only legitimate writer is the user during a manual milestone bump. |
| **SP-2** | Never include or suggest a **time, timestamp, clock, 12-hour, 24-hour, AM/PM, ISO time, relative time ("today", "now"), fixed-zone time, or UTC** value inside `readme.txt`, in chat, in docs, or in any helper. The marker line's date stamp is the only temporal token allowed and is written by hand. |
| **SP-3** | Never propose date utilities, formatters, helpers, libraries, or wrappers (`Intl.DateTimeFormat`, `dd-MMM-YYYY`, locale formatters, time-zone helpers) "for `readme.txt`". |
| **SP-4** | Never suggest writing the **git commit time, last-update time, last-modified stamp, build time, or deploy time** into `readme.txt` — neither in the body, nor as a comment, nor as a script that injects it, nor "somewhere in the readme". |
| **SP-5** | Never propose git hooks, pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions, CI steps, build hooks, or release scripts that touch `readme.txt`. It is outside every automation pipeline. |
| **SP-6** | Never ask the user to choose, confirm, or "improve" a `readme.txt` format. The format is fixed; do not request alternatives. |
| **SP-7** | If a user message **explicitly orders** a one-time `readme.txt` write (e.g., "write readme.txt with X"), honor that single write **exactly as specified**, then re-apply SP-1 through SP-6 for every subsequent message. Honoring an explicit one-shot does **not** open the door to follow-ups, refresh suggestions, scheduled updates, formatters, or automation around it. An explicit one-shot also does **not** override SP-2/SP-4/SP-8 — a one-shot whose payload IS prohibited content (time, clock, 12-hr/24-hr, AM/PM, fixed-zone time, UTC, git-update/commit/build/deploy stamp) is still refused; the user must re-target to a non-readme.txt file or amend this memory. |
| **SP-8** | Never suggest, insert, comment, or script a **git update time, git commit time, last-update time, last-modified time, build time, deploy time, or any "stamp"** anywhere in `readme.txt` — not in the body, not in a header/footer, not as a comment, not "somewhere in the readme", not in a sibling helper, sidecar, or generator that targets readme.txt. Closes the "somewhere in the readme" loophole. AI agents reading this rule MUST commit it to working memory under "strictly prohibited — readme.txt" on first read and never re-propose it. |
| **SP-9** | Never **ask, prompt, suggest, recommend, or surface a `readme.txt` update as an action item** — not in clarifying questions, not in "next steps", not in remaining-task lists, not in changelog/version-bump checklists, not as a post-commit reminder, not in any form. `readme.txt` is invisible to the AI's task surface. The user writes it manually on their own schedule; the AI never raises it. Mentioning it (even to ask "should I update readme.txt?") is a violation. |

## Enforcement

- Violating any SP-N rule is treated as a regression.
- AI agents must read this file before touching `readme.txt`, cite the
  sequence number when refusing, and never mention "readme.txt + time" in
  any forward suggestion or roadmap entry.
- This file, `.lovable/strictly-avoid.md`, and
  `spec/01-spec-authoring-guide/09-exceptions.md` are mirror copies and
  must move together.
