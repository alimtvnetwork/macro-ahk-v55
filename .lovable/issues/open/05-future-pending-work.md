# Pending Work — Deferred Items

**Last Updated**: 2026-04-23
**Extension Version**: v2.225.0

---

## Active Pending Items (actionable)

_None — TS Migration V2 backlog cleared. See "Recently Completed" below._

## Deferred — Do NOT Pick Automatically

Per `mem://preferences/deferred-workstreams`, only the discuss-later marketplace workstream remains deferred. React component tests and manual Chrome E2E are allowed again as of 2026-05-25 and must not be treated as blockers.

- **Exact path:** `spec/21-app/02-features/misc-features/pstore-marketplace.md`
- **Missing item:** backend API/service contract and implementation for the marketplace workstream.
- **Reason:** user preference keeps this in discuss-later mode; do not auto-pick, recommend, or surface it as a next action until explicitly reopened.

This deferred item must NOT be surfaced as a recommended next action until the user explicitly reopens it.
