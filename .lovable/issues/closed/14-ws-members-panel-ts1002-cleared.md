# Solved: ws-members-panel.ts TS1002 pending issue cleared

## Problem

`.lovable/pending-issues/readme.md` still claimed `standalone-scripts/macro-controller/src/ws-members-panel.ts` had a TS1002 unterminated string around the `⬇ CSV</button>` header button.

## Root Cause

The pending issue was stale. The referenced file now contains a properly terminated concatenated string at the CSV button line, and the exact file no longer reports syntax diagnostics.

## Verification

- `rg "⬇ CSV|ws-members-panel|TS1002"` found only the stale pending note plus the live CSV button.
- A targeted TypeScript `transpileModule` syntax check on `standalone-scripts/macro-controller/src/ws-members-panel.ts` returned zero diagnostics.

## Resolution

Moved the stale pending note out of `.lovable/pending-issues/` so it no longer blocks the active audit sweep.
