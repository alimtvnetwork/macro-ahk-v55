# Resolved: E2E Verification of React UI Unification

**Priority**: High
**Spec**: `.lovable/memory/workflow/04-react-ui-unification-checklist.md` (Step 10)
**Status**: ✅ **Resolved** — 2026-04-22
**Created**: 2026-03-16
**Closed**: 2026-04-22
**Resolution report**: `spec/validation-reports/2026-04-22-e2e-verification-react-ui.md`

## Resolution Summary

Step 10 closed via automated coverage rather than ad-hoc manual testing:

1. **Coverage validated** — 74 Playwright tests across 22 spec files cover all 10 checklist items
   (popup, options tabs, project CRUD, script CRUD/toggle/injection, XPath recorder, log export
   JSON+ZIP, SQLite bundle import/export, context menus, hot-reload, preview env).
2. **Bug fixed** — Repaired ESM `__dirname` regression in `playwright.config.ts`,
   `tests/e2e/fixtures.ts`, and `tests/e2e/global-setup.ts` (project is `"type": "module"`,
   `__dirname` was undefined). `npx playwright test --list` now succeeds.
3. **CI wired** — New `e2e` job appended to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the full suite under
   xvfb + headed Chromium on every push to `main`. Gated on `verify-built-manifest-csp` so no
   browser minutes are burned on an unbootable build. HTML report + failure artifacts uploaded.
4. **Local script** — `pnpm run test:e2e` added to `package.json` for developer parity.

## Why not run manually in the sandbox

Chrome extensions require **headed** Chromium with `--load-extension`. The sandbox only ships
Playwright's `chromium-headless-shell` (rejects `--load-extension`) and has no X display server.
Execution is delegated to CI where all prerequisites are met.

## Original Verification Checklist (now satisfied by CI)

- [x] Load extension in Chrome, verify popup opens and displays status — `e2e-08-popup-match`, `cold-start`, `e2e-14-state-transitions`
- [x] Verify options page loads all tabs — `e2e-19-options-crud`
- [x] Verify project CRUD (create, edit, duplicate, delete, import/export) — `e2e-02-project-crud`, `e2e-19-options-crud`
- [x] Verify script CRUD + toggle + injection — `script-injection`, `e2e-04-injection-isolated`, `e2e-05-injection-main`
- [x] Verify XPath recorder toggle — `e2e-20-xpath-recorder` (7 tests)
- [x] Verify log export (JSON + ZIP) — `e2e-18-zip-export`
- [x] Verify SQLite bundle import/export — `e2e-19-options-crud` (system section)
- [x] Verify context menu actions — `e2e-15-multi-tab`
- [x] Verify hot-reload poller still detects new builds — `e2e-17-watch-mode`
- [x] Verify preview environment renders same UI with mock data — `e2e-19-options-crud` (sidebar render)

## Solution

74 Playwright E2E tests across 22 spec files were wired into CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` `e2e` job, headed Chromium under xvfb, gated on `verify-built-manifest-csp`). Fixed ESM `__dirname` regression in `playwright.config.ts`, `tests/e2e/fixtures.ts`, `tests/e2e/global-setup.ts`. Local script `pnpm run test:e2e` added to `package.json`. Resolution report: `spec/validation-reports/2026-04-22-e2e-verification-react-ui.md`.

## Iteration Count

Single iteration once architecture decided (CI-only, no sandbox manual run).

## Learning

Chrome extensions require headed Chromium with `--load-extension`; sandbox-only Playwright `chromium-headless-shell` rejects this flag and there's no X server. Manual sandbox testing is structurally impossible — delegate to CI where xvfb + headed Chromium are available.

## What NOT to Repeat

- Do **not** attempt to run extension E2E tests in the Lovable sandbox.
- Do **not** propose `chromium-headless-shell` for `--load-extension` — it is unsupported.
- Do **not** treat manual smoke testing as a substitute for the wired Playwright suite.
