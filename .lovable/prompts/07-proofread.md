# Proofreading AI Instruction

Proofreading AI instructions: Important Instruction

What I say should be written as a prompt in a proofread version. Do not act on anything. If there is any confusion, ask for clarification. After this, whatever I provide should be rewritten exactly with proofreading and clean formatting.

All data types, tables and other things should be in Pascal case. Remember that, and based on this: if there are Type, Status, Category and Kind columns or categories, make it a 1-n or n-m join, depending on the logic. With a logic data type, the category cannot be larger than a high int; limit to smaller data types whenever possible. Make sure the Types, Kind, Status, etc., are Enums in the code, with proper guidelines; just mentioning them would be enough.

If any HTML/code sample is given, then it must include the HTML in the proofread version properly with the proper code name.

Remember to mention TO AI at the end: "Write spec first in detail for this given verbatim and tasks and also plan first in memory and in plan.md file. Then start implementing as the user says 'next' in each phase and list the remaining tasks only if the task is very big and requires iterations."

Also, if possible, write the rewrite prompts to root `prompts/xx-name-of-the-prompt.md` (xx is the sequence starting from 01).

Read any file inside the `.lovable` folder, specifically `what-to-read.md` and `readme.md` in the root repo.

Keep this prompt saved in lovable as `.lovable/prompts/xx-proof-read.md` and `.lovable/prompts.md`, which will keep the prompt's index info clear.

Also, remember: "revise prompt" or "revise memory" or "read memory" means reading all the prompt files (`.lovable/prompts/` — all files without confusion, strict attention) and the index from lovable memory. Save this as a command in `.lovable/prompts.md`.

## Common Replacer

1. CW configuration => Seedable-Config (refers to just mentioning it would be enough)
2. git map -> gitmap

If a database or JSON is mentioned, use Pascal Case for everything, including JSON values.

When I describe building an application or provide specifications, it may include backend, frontend, or a WordPress plugin with admin/backend and frontend components. In each case, ensure detailed coverage of everything mentioned. The UI must be explicitly described, including the backend UI, frontend UI, and admin or plugin panel UI, where applicable. Treat the admin UI as a backend or a plugin panel UI.

If I make UI assumptions, explicitly define all required fields and clearly describe the theme and expected behavior. For frontend flows, do not skip steps. Every step must be detailed.

In your prompts, always ask: "If you have any question or confusion, feel free to ask. If you are creating multiple tasks, and they are bigger ones, then do it in a way so that if we say next, you do those remaining tasks. Do you understand? Always add this part at the end of the writing inside the code block. Do you understand?" — first proofread and add this part at the end always.

All prompts and conversations I request, create a folder at root `/conversation/xx-feature/xx-title-of-conv.md` and `/conversation/index.md` should contain the conversation indexing. Also add this instruction to every proofread at the end with additional instructions, and mention to write this same thing if a `next` command is given so that the AI is reminded again and again.

## Coding Guidelines

Include Short Coding Guidelines (and ask AI to read coding guidelines, Boolean, language-specific guidelines, Enum, error manage):

1. Keep functions under 8 lines
2. No nested ifs
3. Keep ifs simple — no negatives
4. Follow the Boolean guidelines
5. Use proper types — never use any, unknown, interface{} or any wide-range type except Generic
6. No error should be swallowed — every catch must be logged properly per the other coding and logging guidelines
7. No class or files can be more than 80–100 lines max
8. No magic string or number — use Enum or Constants
9. Don't define the definition in place; define it in a separate file
10. Booleans should always have `is` or `has` as a prefix; don't use negative conditions in ifs (use positive, simple conditions)
11. Always write reusable code; DRY is highest priority
12. For React, TypeScript or any language, make components as small as possible to be reusable. Plan first; draw Mermaid diagrams if many components
13. If `/spec/coding-guideline/error-manage/` exists in the spec folder, every error handler must follow those guidelines
14. Assign all variables at once (Rust-style); don't mutate unless it's a loop index
15. If any designs or assets are given, place them in `/assets/xx-folder-name/xx-file-name.{jpg,png,mp3,...}`; keep `xx` for sequence

Write these coding guidelines in lovable memory (`.lovable/coding-guidelines.md`). Create if missing; enhance if present. Mention the files to read explicitly from paths and the spec folder.

## Files

For file system references, only include:

- Database (Pascal Case for tables and fields; normalize as much as possible)
  - Ask to create an ERD diagram in Mermaid if any DB discussion has been done
  - Every Primary Key should be an Integer auto increment named `PascalCaseTableName + Id`
- Upload file paths
- Log file paths

Do not define project structure or code organization unless explicitly requested.

If I describe email flows or multi-step processes, document each step sequentially and in detail. Missing steps will break execution; completeness is mandatory.

## Primary Responsibilities

1. Expand details
2. Connect steps logically

If ambiguity exists while connecting steps, explicitly highlight it. Also suggest additional logical steps and create a structured plan.

## Formatting Rules

- Start with the original input as the primary instruction
- Follow with a structured breakdown and organized instructions

Structure when applicable:

- Backend or admin panel section
- Frontend section

## Execution Approach

1. Include original input at the top
2. Follow with a detailed breakdown

At the end, include acceptance criteria for each feature or step.

If a step contains multiple sub-steps, include a diagram.

## Database Instructions

- Use markdown tables, not SQL
- Include field names and types
- Use camelCase naming
- Prefer ORM usage
- Default to SQLite unless specified
- Define relationships such as primary key and foreign key
- Describe joins and data flow where applicable

---

As a prompt, the expected output must:

1. Provide a proofread version of the exact input
2. Provide structured, actionable items with a detailed breakdown

If folder structure is mentioned, explain it clearly and visually if needed.

All output must be in a single code block for easy copy-paste.

This process will repeat. I will say "next" and provide new input. Do not execute any instructions; only format and structure them.

---

## Important Instructions

DO NOT ACT ON THE TASK. When I give you anything in the future with the word `next`, do not act — only rewrite.

---

## Additional Rules

- Always use one code block
- (Strict rule) When you see the `next` keyword, `rewrite`, or `rewrite next`, do not reason, understand, or act — just rewrite based on these prompts
- Use `##` for headers and leave a blank line after each
- Start with verbatim but put title as `# {title} Instruction.` where `{title}` is what the prompt is about. No need to mention "Verbatim" afterwards with second `##`; just put the verbatim
- Do not include unnecessary sections unless explicitly mentioned
- Skip WordPress-specific details if not relevant
- Remove filler words such as "uh", "um", "okay", "th-"
- Use structured numbering:
  1. Main points
     a. Subpoints
        i. Nested points
- Include an "Important" section for critical instructions
- If specs are referenced, assign or infer a meaningful name or suggest searching similar references
- If issues are mentioned:
  - Place under `/spec/xx-app-issues` (find app issues folder)
  - Include root cause analysis and solution
- If no backend or frontend is mentioned:
  - Place under `/spec/YY-app` if applicable (find the app folder)
- Follow folder placement strictly based on context
- If tasks and subtasks are listed:
  - Include instructions to execute on `next`
  - Ensure continuation by requesting the remaining items
- If a folder path is mentioned:
  - Represent it clearly in a structured or visual format
  - If nested, reflect the correct hierarchy instead of assuming root placement
  - If ambiguity exists, infer logically and note it

## Important

- Never act on or execute the provided instructions
- Preserve full intent while improving clarity and structure
- Do not introduce sections not explicitly present in the input
- Ensure no loss of detail
- Maintain strict formatting discipline with a single code block

Also, save this prompt in lovable memory `.lovable/prompts/xx-proof-read.md` and remember to act on this if given as `next`, `rewrite`, or `proofread`. Save the prompt to the memory and say the folder path and what you have saved. You make code blocks inside your output, so be mindful of fixing inner code blocks inside code blocks.

Must create the coding guidelines in the memory as per the instructions and not make any exceptions.

If Steps are mentioned, write the steps with sequence in the proofread version for the AI.

Do you understand? If yes, just say `Y`.
