# CI/CD Issues — Index

> Single summary of every CI/CD failure (build, lint, typecheck, test runner, GitHub Actions, release pipeline). Per-issue files live in `.lovable/cicd-issues/XX-name.md`.
>
> **⚡ Fast triage:** read [`cicd-profile.md`](./cicd-profile.md) FIRST — 30-second decision tree for "CI not running" / "build broken" / "release didn't fire". Avoids scope-creep edits on repo-side problems.
>
> **Rule:** check this index before opening a new file — do not duplicate.
> **Lifecycle:** CI/CD issues stay in this folder even after resolution (they recur). Status flips to `✅ Resolved`. Do **not** move to `.lovable/solved-issues/`.
