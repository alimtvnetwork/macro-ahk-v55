/**
 * ext-smoke-02.ts
 *
 * Stage-2 extension smoke check: asserts that the required source
 * entries the build chain depends on actually exist on disk before
 * Vite is invoked. Catches accidental moves/renames of popup/options
 * HTML or manifest that would otherwise fail later with a noisy
 * Rollup "could not resolve entry" error.
 *
 * Run: bun scripts/ext-smoke-02.ts
 * Exit: 0 on success, 1 on first missing entry (fail-fast, no retry).
