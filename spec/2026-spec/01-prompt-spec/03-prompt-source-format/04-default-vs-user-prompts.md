# T34 · Defaults vs user prompts — merge precedence

**Created:** 2026-06-02

A running Prompts feature typically merges **two** sources:

1. **Defaults bundle** — read-only prompts shipped with the HostApp
   (`isDefault: true`, deterministic ids `default-<slug>`).
2. **User store** — prompts the End User created or edited
   (`isDefault: false`).

## Merge algorithm

```
final = []
for each default D:
    U = user.getBySlug(D.slug)
    if U exists:
        final.push(U)              # user override wins
    else:
        final.push(D)
for each user prompt U where slug not in defaults:
    final.push(U)
sort final by (category, order, title)
```

## Rules

1. **User overrides are by slug**, not by id. Editing a default prompt
   creates a *new* user record with a *new* id but the *same* slug.
2. **Defaults are never deleted.** "Delete" on a default record sets
   a `hidden: true` flag in the user store; the merge skips hidden
   defaults. Re-show by removing the flag.
3. **Restoring a default** = delete the user override with the same slug.
4. **Version drift:** if a shipped default's `version` is newer than
   the user override's `version`, the UI MAY surface an "update
   available" affordance, but MUST NOT auto-overwrite the override.
5. **`createdAt` / `updatedAt`** on an override always reflect the
   user's write, not the default's timestamps.

## Why "by slug, not by id"

Default ids are deterministic across installs (`default-next-tasks`),
but user records are created with fresh UUIDs. Slug is the only stable
key both sides agree on.

## Acceptance

- [ ] The implementation satisfies the `T34 · Defaults vs user prompts — merge precedence` contract in this file and the folder-level acceptance target: prompt source files round-trip through parse and emit without semantic drift.
- [ ] Verification passes when `UT-source-001..008` passes, and `node scripts/audit/check-acceptance.mjs --root=spec/2026-spec` reports this file has a machine-checkable acceptance contract.

## Determinism (MUST)

- **MUST** keep `info.json` at the prompt folder root with exactly the keys defined in `02-info-json.md`; extra keys fail `schemas/prompt.schema.json`.
- **MUST** read `prompt.md` body as UTF-8 with explicit BOM strip; trailing whitespace is preserved verbatim (paste-fidelity).
- **MUST** import/export bundles as ZIP with `prompts-bundle.json` manifest validated by `schemas/prompts-bundle.schema.json` before any disk write.
- **MUST** treat the `default/` folder as read-only at runtime; user edits clone into `user/` and never modify defaults in place.

## Pitfalls / Counter-examples

- ❌ Detecting prompt type by file extension. ✅ Read `info.json#kind` — the source of truth.
- ❌ Auto-rewriting `info.json` with a "last modified" timestamp. ✅ See `mem://constraints/readme-txt-prohibitions` SP-1..SP-7 — no auto time stamps in source files.
- ❌ Streaming a ZIP import directly into IndexedDB without schema validation. ✅ Validate the full bundle in memory first; a single bad entry rejects the whole import.
- ❌ Trimming the prompt body to "clean up" whitespace. ✅ Body is paste-fidelity; trim only at the editor surface, never at the loader.
- ❌ Hardcoding the import path. ✅ Use `STORAGE_PROMPTS_ROOT` constant.

## Numeric Bounds (source-of-truth)

- Default operation budget MUST be **5000 ms** (per `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md`).
- Maximum retry attempts MUST be **3 items** before escalation.
- See [folder index](../readme.md) for sibling specs and cross-references.
