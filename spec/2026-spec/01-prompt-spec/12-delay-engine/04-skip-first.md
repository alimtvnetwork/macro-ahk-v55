# 04 — Skip First

**Date:** 2026-06-02
**Task:** T79

## Default source of truth

Implementations MUST use `SKIP_FIRST_DELAY` from [Runtime Defaults](../reference/05-runtime-defaults.md). When it is true, the engine skips the delay before the first task in a drain cycle.

The user just clicked "Run" — making them wait for `DELAY_MS` before anything visible happens feels broken.

```ts
let firstTaskDone = false;
async function maybeDelay(cfg: DelayConfig): Promise<void> {
  if (!firstTaskDone && (cfg.skipFirst ?? true)) {
    firstTaskDone = true;
    return;
  }
  await sleep(effectiveDelay(cfg));
}
```

## State scope

`firstTaskDone` is **per drain cycle**, not per process:
- Resets to `false` on `onQueueDrained`.
- Resets to `false` after a `cancelAll`.
- Does **not** reset on `pause` / `resumeLoop` — pausing mid-run shouldn't grant another "free" immediate task.

## When to set `skipFirst: false`

- Hosts where a sub-second cadence would race their own rate limiter and trigger a 429.
- Plan mode, where the first task is also the heaviest — a small lead-in delay lets the UI render the queue list before the first stream starts.

## Acceptance

- [ ] The implementation satisfies the `04 — Skip First` contract in this file and the folder-level acceptance target: default delay, settings, jitter, skip-first, and pause semantics use runtime defaults.
- [ ] Verification passes when `UT-delay-001..006` passes, and `node scripts/audit/check-acceptance.mjs --root=spec/2026-spec` reports this file has a machine-checkable acceptance contract.

Numeric defaults referenced in this file are canonical in [Runtime Defaults](../reference/05-runtime-defaults.md). If a value differs, the SOT wins.

## Determinism (MUST)

- **MUST** bind `DELAY_MS`, `JITTER_MS`, `SKIP_FIRST_DELAY` to `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md`; settings UI MUST clamp to declared min/max.
- **MUST** compute jitter as `DELAY_MS + randInt(-JITTER_MS, +JITTER_MS)` with `Math.random()` seeded by `crypto.getRandomValues` when available.
- **MUST** honour `SKIP_FIRST_DELAY=true` by emitting the first prompt with zero delay; subsequent prompts apply the full delay+jitter.
- **MUST** pause the delay timer when `pauseRequested=true` and resume from the remaining ms — never restart from zero.

## Pitfalls / Counter-examples

- ❌ `setTimeout(fn, DELAY_MS)` with no `clearTimeout` on cancel. ✅ Pair with teardown (see `mem://standards/timer-and-observer-teardown`).
- ❌ Jitter that can produce negative delays. ✅ `Math.max(0, DELAY_MS + jitter)`.
- ❌ Restarting the delay on pause/resume. ✅ Track `remainingMs` at pause; resume schedules `remainingMs`.
- ❌ Hardcoding 1500ms inline. ✅ Import the named constant.
- ❌ Adding exponential backoff on send failure. ✅ Fail fast; surface to user (no-retry policy).

## Audit Anchors (source-of-truth)

- Implementations MUST honor every numeric default declared in [runtime defaults](../reference/05-runtime-defaults.md); see also [related](../readme.md).
- Runtime-default values MUST be read from named constants in `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md`, not copied into prose examples.
- Any deviation MUST raise a spec issue before code is shipped (`60 s` review window minimum).
