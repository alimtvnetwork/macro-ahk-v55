# Fixtures Catalog

Path: `tests/fixtures/prompts/`.

| Fixture | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `minimal/` | Single prompt, no variables — happy path |
| `with-variables/` | All variable types (string, number, boolean, enum) + defaults |
| `sensitive/` | `sensitive: true` variables — masking test |
| `invalid-info-json/` | Schema-violating `info.json` — loader error path |
| `invalid-prompt-md/` | Body > 64 KB — size limit test |
| `import-zip.zip` | End-to-end import round-trip |
| `duplicate-ids/` | Two prompts share `id` — conflict path |
| `host-overrides.json` | Sample settings override blob |
| `queue-100/` | 100 pre-built tasks — capacity test |

Loader fixtures must round-trip: `parse → emit → parse` byte-equal.

## Acceptance

- [ ] The implementation satisfies the `Fixtures Catalog` contract in this file and the folder-level acceptance target: the prompt feature spec remains internally linked and blind-AI implementable.
- [ ] Verification passes when `node scripts/audit/check-dangling-links.mjs` passes, and `node scripts/audit/check-acceptance.mjs --root=spec/2026-spec` reports this file has a machine-checkable acceptance contract.

## Determinism Notes

- This spec MUST be implemented exactly as written; any divergence MUST raise a spec issue first.
- Numeric defaults (timeouts, retries, sizes) MUST be sourced from `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md`; prose MUST cite constant names, not duplicate numeric values.
- All boolean toggles MUST have an explicit default of `false` unless the runtime-defaults table specifies otherwise.
- Implementations MUST treat undocumented states as a hard error and SHALL log via the namespace logger.

## Pitfalls

- **Anti-pattern:** silently swallowing errors with empty `catch {}` — every failure MUST go through `Logger.error()` with `Reason` + `ReasonDetail`.
- **Edge case:** new-tab / blank navigations (`about:blank`, `chrome://newtab/`) — gate every entry point with `isNewTabOrBlankUrl()`.
- **Counter-example:** hardcoding a timezone string (e.g. `Asia/Kuala_Lumpur`) — always render in the user's local timezone via `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`.
- **Gotcha:** assuming Chrome `storage.local` is synchronous — it is async and MUST be awaited; never read it during top-level module evaluation.

## Audit Anchors (source-of-truth)

- Implementations MUST honor every numeric default declared in [runtime defaults](../reference/05-runtime-defaults.md); see also [related](../readme.md).
- Runtime-default values MUST be read from named constants in `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md`, not copied into prose examples.
- Any deviation MUST raise a spec issue before code is shipped (`60 s` review window minimum).
