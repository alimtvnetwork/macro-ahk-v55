# T41 · Trigger surface

**Created:** 2026-06-02

Where and how the End User opens the Prompts dropdown. The Prompts
feature ships **no opinion** on the host UI chrome — the integrator
picks one or more triggers from the menu below.

## Trigger options (integrator picks ≥ 1)

| Id | Surface | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `floating-button` | A small floating action button anchored near the ChatBox. | Default for web HostApps. Z-index must clear modals; placement is host-defined. |
| `keyboard-shortcut` | A user-configurable keyboard combo. | Default suggestion: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (macOS: `⌘⇧P`). MUST be opt-in to avoid collisions. |
| `slash-command` | Typing `/p` (or another configured prefix) at the start of the ChatBox opens the dropdown inline. | Adapter must intercept `Input` events; cancel on space/escape. |
| `context-menu` | Right-click on the ChatBox shows a "Prompts…" entry. | Optional; rarely the only trigger. |
| `host-api` | Imperative `prompts.open()` call exposed to the HostApp. | Always present; backs all other triggers. |

## Contract every trigger must satisfy

1. Calls `prompts.open({ anchor })` where `anchor` is a DOM rect or
   `null` (centred).
2. Focus moves to the dropdown's search box on open.
3. Re-opening while open is a no-op (do not stack).
4. Closing returns focus to the previous active element (typically
   the ChatBox).

## Anti-patterns

- **Auto-open on page load** — never. Only user action opens the dropdown.
- **Open while the user is typing into the ChatBox** without an
  explicit gesture (slash-command counts as explicit).
- **Trigger that hides without warning** — every trigger must be
  discoverable from at least one persistent affordance.

## Host question

Q-UI-1 (deferred to integrator): which trigger(s) ship on day one?
Default recommendation: **floating-button + host-api**.

## Acceptance

- [ ] The implementation satisfies the `T41 · Trigger surface` contract in this file and the folder-level acceptance target: trigger, dropdown, keyboard, search, and accessibility behavior remains user-verifiable.
- [ ] Verification passes when `CT-ui-001..009 and E2E-ui-001..003` passes, and `node scripts/audit/check-acceptance.mjs --root=spec/2026-spec` reports this file has a machine-checkable acceptance contract.

## Determinism (MUST)

- **MUST** open the dropdown only on the trigger keystroke / button click defined in `01-trigger.md`; never on focus or hover.
- **MUST** keep the search filter case-insensitive, diacritic-folded, and bounded to `SEARCH_DEBOUNCE_MS` (120) debounce — see [reference/05-runtime-defaults.md](../reference/05-runtime-defaults.md).
- **MUST** expose every dropdown row with `role="option"`, `aria-selected`, and keyboard navigation per `04-keyboard.md`; no mouse-only paths.
- **MUST** announce paste success / failure via the toast contract in `06-injection-contract/05-paste-toast.md` — no silent failures.

## Pitfalls / Counter-examples

- ❌ Re-rendering the entire dropdown on every keystroke. ✅ Virtualize once row count > `DROPDOWN_VIRTUALIZE_THRESHOLD` (50).
- ❌ Trapping focus inside the dropdown. ✅ `Esc` returns focus to the editor caret position.
- ❌ Showing "no results" only when the user pauses typing. ✅ Update synchronously after debounce.
- ❌ Mouse hover auto-selects a row. ✅ Hover highlights only; selection requires click or `Enter`.
- ❌ Tooltip rendered with a hardcoded timezone. ✅ Use `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`.

## Audit Anchors (source-of-truth)

- Implementations MUST honor every numeric default declared in [runtime defaults](../reference/05-runtime-defaults.md); see also [related](../readme.md).
- Runtime-default values MUST be read from named constants in `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md`, not copied into prose examples.
- Any deviation MUST raise a spec issue before code is shipped (`60 s` review window minimum).
