## Audit Findings (2026-04-22)
### Issues Resolved
1. **Duplicate `05-` prefix** — `05-json-config-pipeline.md` and `05-module-splitting.md` both used the `05-` prefix, violating Spec Authoring Guide v3.2.0 unique-prefix rule.
   - **Fix**: Renamed `05-json-config-pipeline.md` → `05a-json-config-pipeline.md` (sub-spec of Phase 05).
2. **Stale status banner — `01-initialization-fix.md`** — said "Status: Planning" despite the readme + production code confirming completion.
   - **Fix**: Updated to "✅ Complete (2026-04-09)".
3. **Stale status banner — `05-module-splitting.md`** — said "Status: In Progress" despite all listed splits showing ✅ in the body and the parent migration being complete.
   - **Fix**: Updated to "✅ Complete (2026-04-09)" and added a Completed date.
4. **Broken relative path in `05-module-splitting.md`** — referenced `../../03-coding-guidelines/03-coding-guidelines-spec/00-overview.md` (pre-reorganization path).
   - **Fix**: Updated to `../../../../02-coding-guidelines/00-overview.md` (canonical v3.2.0 path).
5. **Missing `99-consistency-report.md`** — required by Spec Authoring Guide v3.2.0 for every spec folder.
   - **Fix**: This file created.
6. **`readme.md` did not list `05a-json-config-pipeline.md`** — orphaned spec not surfaced from the index.
   - **Fix**: Added `05a` row to the phases table.
### Outstanding
None. The folder is now fully compliant with v3.2.0 standards.

## Cross-Reference Sanity Check
All internal cross-references point to canonical post-reorganization paths:
- `spec/22-app-issues/23-workspace-name-wrong-initial-load.md` ✅
- `spec/22-app-issues/check-button/07-auth-bridge-stall.md` ✅
- `../../../../02-coding-guidelines/00-overview.md` ✅
- `.lovable/memory/features/macro-controller/startup-initialization.md` ✅
No legacy paths (`spec/03-coding-guidelines/`, `spec/10-macro-controller/`, etc.) remain in this folder.
---
## Sign-Off
✅ **`ts-migration-v2/` is clean.** All 8 phases complete, all stale banners corrected, prefix collision resolved, consistency report present. The migration is fully retired and the spec accurately reflects the production codebase.
