# Audit — readiness-score.md (Bogus 100/100)
**Audited:** 2026-06-02  · 44 lines
## Findings — line-by-line falsification
| Row | Claim | Evidence cited | Reality | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 Concept clarity | 10/10 | `plan.md`, `engine/00-architecture.md` | `engine/00` is content-in-reserved-slot (C25); `plan.md` cited is `.lovable/plans/` (C9 leak) | **Fail** |
| 2 Step kinds | 10/10 | `engine/01-state-machine.md` (8 kinds) | Doc exists but `StepKindId` mapping incomplete (C58) | Partial |
| 3 Variable system | 10/10 | `engine/05-variable-interpolator.md`, `guards/04` | Guard exists; **`engine/05` may not enumerate placeholder syntax — `mem://features/prompt-variables` is MISSING (C67)** | **Fail** |
| 4 JSON contracts | 10/10 | `json/00`–`09`, `schemas/macro-definition.schema.json` | **`json/` folder DOES NOT EXIST (C29).** Schema path unverifiable. | **Fail** |
| 5 Engine internals | 10/10 | `engine/00`–`09` (10 files) | Files exist; quality issues in C26 batch audit | Partial |
| 6 UI surface | 10/10 | `ui/00`–`09` | **`ui/` folder DOES NOT EXIST (C29).** | **Fail** |
| 7 Guards | 10/10 | `guards/00`–`04` | 5 files exist; C41–C45 raise Critical gaps | Partial |
| 8 Observability | 10/10 | `observability/00`–`04` | Files exist; C53 Critical drift from Core memory | Partial |
| 9 Testing | 10/10 | `testing/00`–`04` (8/7/8 tests) | Files exist; **test counts unverifiable (no test files referenced)** (C46–C50) | **Fail** |
| 10 Cross-cutting | 10/10 | `macro-prompts-folder` memory, CHANGELOG, MIGRATION, this file | 2/3 memories missing (C66, C67); circular ("this file") | **Fail** |
**Honest total:** 6 dimensions fail outright, 4 partial. Conservative score: **35–45 / 100**.
### Smoke checklist (also bogus)
- "What is the exact JSON shape of a `MacroDefinition`?" — answer file (`json/00`) DOES NOT EXIST.
- "How is `RunId` generated?" — `engine/02-resume-after-sw-restart.md` exists but C59 flags dual-authority.
## Severity
**Critical.** Self-grading with non-existent evidence is the highest-trust failure in the audit; it gave the user false confidence to ship.
## Fix order
1. Replace 100/100 with conservative honest score (~40/100).
2. Mark every "Fail" row with a remediation pointer to C29 / C66 / C67.
3. Regenerate the score AFTER fix-pass — never before.
