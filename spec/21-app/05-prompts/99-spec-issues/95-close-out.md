## What needs the user's decision now
Three branching paths — pick one:
### Option A — Run the full fix-pass (recommended)
- **What:** Open `.lovable/plans/spec-prompt-macros-fix-pass.md`; execute via `next`-style batches.
- **Effort:** ~14 batches (≈28 min agent time) → 85/100; ~20 batches (≈40–60 min) → genuine 100/100.
- **Pros:** Subsystem becomes truly blind-AI ready; CHANGELOG/READINESS-SCORE become honest.
- **Cons:** Largest time investment.
### Option B — Critical-only fix (triage)
- **What:** Address only the 14 Critical items: C29, C41, C42, C45, C53, C57, C58, C61, C62, C63, C66, C67, C70, C72.
- **Effort:** ~7 batches → ≈65/100.
- **Pros:** Removes immediate footguns + dangling memory references.
- **Cons:** Leaves 17 High items; CHANGELOG and READINESS-SCORE stay roughly honest but spec still fragmented.
### Option C — Document-and-defer
- **What:** Mark all findings in plan.md as "known debt"; ship the subsystem with humans-in-the-loop for variable grammar, thresholds, and JSON shape.
- **Effort:** 1 batch (plan.md edit only).
- **Pros:** Zero risk; preserves engineering bandwidth.
- **Cons:** Cannot honestly claim "blind-AI ready"; expect repeated guidance asks from future agent sessions.
## How to proceed
Say:
- **"start fix-pass"** → Option A (I will create `.lovable/plans/spec-prompt-macros-fix-pass.md` and begin).
- **"critical only"** → Option B.
- **"defer with debt note"** → Option C.
- **"ask question if any understanding issues"** → exits No-Questions Mode; I will ask before proceeding.
