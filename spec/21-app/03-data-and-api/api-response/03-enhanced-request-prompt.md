 Okay, so here the most, uh, important challenge is how to find the bearer token from the, uh, from the JavaScript itself without knowing it. So is it possible to get it from the header, uh, of the website that we are currently in? Because when we are making the request, we already logged in, so it should have the bearer token, just like I have shared. So what is the technique of getting the bearer token, uh, if we are logged in? So I have given the response, uh, that you are going to get, and where you have to make the request, uh, things like that, I have attached it to this. If you have any question and concern, let-

 Uh, hi there. In the combo change, I wanted to add a little bit more, uh, features. Uh, first, analyze that if this is hard to make, but if not, let's try to make it. So, um, when we, uh, make the combo, that's fine, it should be there. We can add, uh, one or two more buttons, uh, to it, and that button will do a little bit more stuff. Um, and ca- can we make this, uh, this item, this, uh, controller on a fixed state, uh, probably last to the, uh, body ending? Can we do that? Uh, is it possible? Is it going to be good or bad? And keep it always floating on the right side, top-- I mean, top right side of the, uh, screen. And next, uh, we have a Plans and Credit button. Okay? If we can, uh, click on this, and after clicking on this, we can actually find a free progress bar. And free progress bar XPath, I have also shared, and from there, we can just mark in the controller that free tier is available. Okay? And also, the total number of credits, it's usually written with quotations and things like that, so you could just do a inner text or things like that. So you will have a full text, like how many credits are available, and you can put it in the controller so that I could see the status. And there could be a Status button, uh, probably with Control+Alt+S, something like this, from the HTML accessibility, not from the AKH. AKH will have no control, uh, or will not progress with it. So if we only click on the Status button or do the Control+Alt+S from the HTML, it will do this. So first, it will click on the Plans and Credit, then check the, uh, free progress bar. So it needs to wait for like... to see if the, uh, total credit is visible, because if the total credit is visible, the others are visible. Um, then it will check if the free progress bar is there, and then get the information from the total credits and update in the controller in the UI so that I can know what's the status of it. And I have one other question: Can we do this without even visiting the, uh, XPath? Is there any way that it is possible to gain this? Okay, so this is, uh, my idea. Let me- know

## Proofread prompt
Do not implement anything. Create or update specifications only. CW means seedable config. Use the requirements below to produce a clear spec update and a phased plan.

### A) Inputs to read first
1. 02-request-sample.txt
   1. Read it fully and extract:
      1. expected response schema for relevant Lovable endpoints
      2. fields that represent workspaces, plans, credits, or free tier signals
      3. any pagination, error shapes, or rate-limit indicators

2. Existing spec file(s)
1. spec.md
   1. Locate the MacroLoop module section
   2. Locate the injection mechanism description
   3. Locate any ComboSwitch controller description

### B) Security and authentication rule
1. Do not attempt to extract bearer tokens from a logged-in browser session or from website headers.
2. Authentication for API requests must use one of these safe approaches:
   1. a user-provided token stored via CW seedable config and persisted to DB after seeding
   2. an official login or authorization flow supported by the platform
   3. a cookie-based authenticated request approach that does not require reading or exfiltrating tokens
3. The spec must document:
   1. where auth configuration lives (CW config keys)
   2. how it is seeded and later edited in UI
   3. how secrets are handled and redacted in logs

### C) Spec update 1: MacroLoop injection change
Update spec.md to state clearly:
1. MacroLoop injection now uses a shared InjectJS component/module
2. MacroLoop no longer uses custom Ctrl+A paste injection
3. The spec must include:
   1. rationale for the change
   2. expected behavior and compatibility notes
   3. any migration notes if old flows existed

Acceptance criteria
1. [ ] spec.md explicitly documents InjectJS as the shared injection mechanism
2. [ ] spec.md explicitly marks Ctrl+A paste injection as deprecated or removed
3. [ ] Any modules depending on old injection behavior are listed for review

### D) Spec update 2: ComboSwitch controller UI enhancements
Define UI requirements for a floating controller and status retrieval.

1. Controller placement and layout
1. The ComboSwitch controller must be:
   1. appended near the end of the document body
   2. fixed position
   3. floating at the top-right corner of the screen
2. Controller must remain visible across navigation states where the extension operates.

2. New buttons
1. Add a Plans and Credits button
2. Add a Status button
   1. must be clickable in UI
   2. must be triggerable by HTML-level keyboard shortcut Control+Alt+S
   3. do not rely on AutoHotkey for this shortcut

3. Display area inside controller
1. Display location: inside the ComboSwitch controller
2. Display fields:
   1. freeTierAvailable boolean indicator
   2. totalCreditsText raw string as displayed (preserve formatting if it includes quotes)
   3. lastCheckedAt timestamp
   4. source of data (api or dom)
3. Sidebar behavior: leave open after running status check

Acceptance criteria
1. [ ] Controller is fixed top-right and appended near end of body
2. [ ] Plans and Credits and Status buttons exist in UI
3. [ ] Control+Alt+S triggers the same flow as clicking Status
4. [ ] Status display updates inside ComboSwitch controller without closing the sidebar

### E) Status retrieval behavior
Define a two-path strategy with API-first and DOM fallback.

1. API-first approach
1. Use the Lovable API endpoint:
   1. GET https://api.lovable.dev/user/workspaces
2. Use 02-request-sample.txt as the authoritative schema reference for parsing.
3. Derive status fields:
   1. determine free tier availability
   2. determine total credits count or credits text
4. Record the raw response and a parsed summary into logs with redaction rules.

2. DOM fallback approach (XPath driven)
Only if API-first cannot provide the needed data:
1. Click Plans and Credits button using this XPath:
   1. /html/body/div[3]/div/div/aside/nav/div[2]/div[2]/button[3]
2. Wait condition
   1. wait until Total Credits Count XPath is visible
   2. Total Credits Count XPath:
      1. /html/body/div[3]/div/div/div/div/div/div/div[10]/div/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[1]/p[2]
3. Free tier detection
1. Look for Free Progress Bar XPath:
   1. /html/body/div[3]/div/div/div/div/div/div/div[10]/div/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[2]/div/div[4]
2. If present, set freeTierAvailable true, otherwise false
4. Credits parsing
1. Read innerText from Total Credits Count node
2. Store the raw innerText as totalCreditsText

3. Check frequency
1. Auto + on-demand
2. Auto frequency must be controlled by CW config (seedable)
   1. example config keys:
      1. creditsAutoCheckEnabled
      2. creditsAutoCheckIntervalSeconds
      3. creditsStatusCacheTtlSeconds
3. On-demand triggers:
   1. clicking Status button
   2. Control+Alt+S shortcut

Acceptance criteria
1. [ ] Status check attempts API first
2. [ ] If API fails or is insufficient, DOM XPath flow runs
3. [ ] DOM flow waits for Total Credits element visibility before reading data
4. [ ] freeTierAvailable and totalCreditsText are populated and displayed

### F) CW seedable config requirements
Define CW seedable config keys relevant to this feature.

1. Required keys
1. workDirectory or extension working root (if applicable to this module)
2. lovableApiBaseUrl default https://api.lovable.dev
3. lovableAuthMode enum (token, officialFlow, cookieSession)
4. lovableBearerToken optional, only if authMode is token
5. creditsAutoCheckEnabled default true
6. creditsAutoCheckIntervalSeconds default value
7. creditsStatusCacheTtlSeconds default value
8. maxRetries default value
9. retryBackoffMs default value

2. Seeding rule
1. Seed from config file on first run
2. Persist to DB
3. DB becomes source of truth after seeding
4. UI can edit DB values
5. Secrets must be redacted in logs and exports

Acceptance criteria
1. [ ] CW keys are listed in spec with defaults
2. [ ] Seeding rules are documented
3. [ ] Token values are never written to logs in plaintext

### G) Logging and diagnostics requirements
Define what must be logged for status checks and injection.

1. Status check logs
1. correlationId per run
2. timestamp and trigger source (auto or onDemand)
3. api attempt result:
   1. endpoint
   2. status code
   3. parsed fields
4. dom fallback attempt result:
   1. xpaths used
   2. visibility wait outcome
   3. extracted innerText
5. errors:
   1. error message
   2. stack trace as per project policy

2. Injection change logs
1. log that InjectJS was used
2. log injection target and result status
3. avoid logging sensitive payloads

Acceptance criteria
1. [ ] Logs clearly show API vs DOM path selection
2. [ ] Logs include enough data to debug failures without exposing secrets
3. [ ] InjectJS usage is observable in logs

### H) Phase-by-phase plan (Lovable-sized)
Create small phases intended to fit roughly within 5 credits each.

Phase 1: Schema and spec discovery
1. Read 02-request-sample.txt
2. Extract required fields and error shapes
3. Draft parsing and status derivation rules in spec
Definition of done
1. [ ] response schema summarized in spec text
2. [ ] fields mapped to UI display fields

Phase 2: spec.md MacroLoop injection update
1. Update MacroLoop section to reflect shared InjectJS usage
2. Add migration notes from Ctrl+A paste
Definition of done
1. [ ] spec.md updated with clear injection contract

Phase 3: ComboSwitch controller UI spec
1. Add fixed placement requirements
2. Add Plans and Credits and Status buttons
3. Add keyboard shortcut requirements
Definition of done
1. [ ] UI flow described step-by-step with acceptance criteria

Phase 4: Status retrieval spec (API-first plus DOM fallback)
1. Define API contract and auth constraints
2. Define XPath flow with wait conditions and extraction
3. Define caching and frequency rules via CW config
Definition of done
1. [ ] Retrieval flow and fallback are unambiguous and testable

Phase 5: CW config and observability spec
1. Define CW keys and seeding rules
2. Define logging schema and redaction rules
Definition of done
1. [ ] CW keys documented
2. [ ] logging and redaction rules documented

### I) Open questions list (do not resolve, only list)
1. Which exact fields in 02-request-sample.txt map to credits and free tier availability? No fields but xpath or the sample request will tell you
2. Is there an official auth mode available for this API that avoids storing bearer tokens? I don't know, there any way to get it from JS from the http header that we are logged in
3. Should the status cache be per workspace, per user, or global? I think one request is enough to get all
4. What is the expected auto-check interval for credits status in normal usage? just for my notification
5. Should the controller show multiple workspaces or a selected workspace only? all
