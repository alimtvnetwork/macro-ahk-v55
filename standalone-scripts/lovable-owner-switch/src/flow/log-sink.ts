/**
 * Owner Switch — per-task log writer.
 *
 * Q10 default: logs are SQLite-tagged rows, NOT files. Each entry is a
 * typed `LogEntry` carrying `TaskId` + `RowIndex` + `Phase` + `Severity`
 * + `Message` + `Timestamp` (UTC ISO is rendered in the user's
 * local timezone by the UI).
 *
 * Storage execution against `RiseupAsiaMacroExt.Sqlite` is wired by
 * P10's runtime adapter (next phase or P11+); this module exposes a
 * `LogSink` interface so the state machine code stays storage-agnostic.
