# Step 61 — CI push trigger policy

**Timestamp:** 2026-06-02
**Core rule:** CI push trigger unfiltered
**Files:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `scripts/__tests__/ci-workflow-trigger-policy.test.mjs`

## Reasoning
Regression has recurred 3× per memory. Filters on `push:` silently skip Lovable branches.

## Findings
- ✅ `ci.yml` uses bare `on: push:` — compliant.
- ✅ Dedicated test exists: `ci-workflow-trigger-policy.test.mjs`.
- ✅ Canary workflow `ping.yml` present.
- 🟢 **Low**: rule is well-defended; blind LLM would have to actively defeat 3 layers.

## Verdict
**Strong**. No action needed.
