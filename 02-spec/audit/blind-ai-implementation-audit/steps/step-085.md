# Step 85 — Readiness reports

**Timestamp:** 2026-06-02
**Memory:** `mem://workflow/readiness-reports` (Reliability + Failure-Chance Report before implementation)

## Reasoning
Pre-implementation reports force the agent to think before coding.

## Findings
- ✅ `.lovable/reports/` directory exists.
- 🟡 **Med**: no enforced template; no count of how many features shipped WITH a readiness report.
- 🟢 **Low**: blind LLM may skip this — no test/lint enforcement.

## Recommendation
Add `.lovable/reports/README.md` with template + a counter.
