# Step 63 — Build lock sentinel

**Timestamp:** 2026-06-02
**Memory:** `mem://features/build-lock-sentinel`

## Reasoning
Concurrent builds race on `dist/` and instruction emit — lock prevents corruption.

## Findings
- ✅ `scripts/lib/build-lock.mjs` exists; `prebuild-clean-and-verify.mjs` gates on `.lovable/build.lock`.
- ✅ Sequential 60s deadline aligns with No-Retry Policy.
- 🟢 **Low**: no test simulating stale lock removal after crash.

## Verdict
**Strong**. Aligned with `mem://constraints/no-retry-policy`.
