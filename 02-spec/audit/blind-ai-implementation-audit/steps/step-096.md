# Step 96 — Cross-cutting: performance audit follow-through (PERF-1..PERF-8)

**Timestamp:** 2026-06-02
**Memory:** `mem://performance/idle-loop-audit-2026-04-25`

## Findings
- ✅ 8 issues catalogued; PERF-1 (hot-reload running in prod) marked critical.
- 🔴 **High**: memory says critical but no evidence in this audit that PERF-1 is fixed. `src/background/hot-reload.ts` exists — needs verification of prod guard.
- 🟡 **Med**: PERF-2..PERF-8 status unknown from memory; no checklist.

## Recommendation
Convert performance audit into a `plan.md` task list with explicit done/wip/todo per PERF-N.
