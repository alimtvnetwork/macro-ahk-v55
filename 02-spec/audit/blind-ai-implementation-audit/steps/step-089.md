# Step 89 — Memory index hygiene

**Timestamp:** 2026-06-02
**File:** `mem://index.md` (Core + Memories sections)

## Reasoning
The memory index is the single most-read document by ANY agent. Its quality bounds the ceiling of blind-LLM performance.

## Findings
- ✅ Core has 26 rules; Memories has 90+ entries with one-line descriptions.
- 🟡 **Med**: no version/last-audited stamp on the index itself; "Updated: 2d ago" is system-injected, not authored.
- 🟡 **Med**: no `what-to-read` pointer in the index (despite `.lovable/what-to-read.md` existing). Repeats finding from S5/S6.
- 🟢 **Low**: a few rules duplicate (e.g. `next` command rule appears in Core AND as a memory link).

## Recommendation
Add a top-of-index line: `Start here: .lovable/what-to-read.md`.
