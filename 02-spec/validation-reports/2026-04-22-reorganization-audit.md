### Governance & history

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| `spec/00-overview.md` (master index) | ✅ Created Phase 7 |
| `spec/99-consistency-report.md` (root health) | ✅ Created Phase 7 |
| `spec/99-archive/` | ✅ 8 subfolders preserving retired content |
| `spec/validation-reports/` | ✅ Contains this report |

### Reserved gaps (intentional)

Slots **13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20** are vacant by design — reserved for future core topics. App content must NOT fill these.

## 3. Cross-Reference Repair

### Phase 8 (initial sweep)
- Files scanned: 1,568
- Files modified: 199
- Path replacements: 337

### Phase 10 (cleanup after auto-cleanup reversion)
- Files scanned (filtered): ~1,560
- Files modified: 209
- Path replacements: 356

### Final state
- **0** old-path references remain anywhere in the repo, with these intentional exceptions:
  - `spec/99-archive/**` — frozen historical content
  - `spec/99-archive/governance-history/spec-reorganization-plan.md` — the legacy plan
  - `.lovable/spec-reorganization-plan-2026-04-22.md` — live tracker (documents old→new)
  - `.lovable/memory/architecture/spec-tree-v3-2-0-layout.md` — authoritative migration table
  - `.gitmap/release/v*.json` — immutable release-history snapshots

---

## 4. Auto-Cleanup Risk Mitigation

During execution, Lovable's auto-cleanup process repeatedly reverted folder moves and file edits between phases (suspected cause: empty-looking renamed dirs and pending writes not being tracked). This was observed at the start of Phases 5, 7, 8, and 10.

**Mitigation applied:** Every phase began with a state-verification step (`ls spec/`) and re-executed any reverted moves before doing new work. Phase 10 included a final cleanup sweep that caught 356 reverted edits.

**Going forward:** If the structure regresses, run the snippet stored at `/tmp/phase10-cleanup.sh` (or recreate it from the migration map in `mem://architecture/spec-tree-v3-2-0-layout`).

## 5. Phase Completion Log

| Phase | Description | Status | Key outcome |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Eliminate duplicates & stale copies | ✅ | 4 legacy folders → `99-archive/` |
| 2 | Create new core stubs | ✅ | 6 stubs (`08`, `09`, `10`, `12`, `14`, `17`) |
| 3 | Rename core folders | ✅ | `09-design-system/` → `07-design-system/` |
| 4 | Redistribute `14-imported/` | ✅ | 8 subtrees redistributed; slot 14 freed |
| 5 | Create `21-app/` & migrate | ✅ | 7 app folders relocated under `21-app/` |
| 6 | Consolidate `22-app-issues/` | ✅ | 99 + 4 files merged with `legacy-` prefix |
| 7 | Root governance | ✅ | Master index + consistency report; legacy archived |
| 8 | Cross-reference repair | ✅ | 337 rewrites across 199 files |
| 9 | Memory & policy sync | ✅ | `mem://index` + new layout doc + migration record |
| 10 | Final validation | ✅ | This report; 356 cleanup rewrites; **0** old refs |

## 6. Health Score Breakdown

| Component | Weight | Score | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| Folder structure compliance | 30 | 30 | All 16 folders have required files |
| Cross-reference integrity | 25 | 25 | Zero old-path refs |
| Migration completeness | 20 | 20 | All 10 phases done |
| Stub maturity | 15 | 9 | 6 stubs are placeholders pending content |
| Documentation quality | 10 | 10 | Master index, layout memory, migration record all present |
| **Total** | **100** | **94** | **A** |

## 7. Outstanding Work (post-reorganization)

These items are not part of the reorganization but were surfaced during it:

1. **Fill the 6 stub folders** (`08-docs-viewer-ui`, `09-code-block-system`, `10-research`, `12-cicd-pipeline-workflows`, `14-update`, `17-consolidated-guidelines`) when content is authored.
2. **App-issues numbering hygiene** — `22-app-issues/` retains historical duplicate prefixes (e.g., two `11-`, two `14-`). Documented as intentional in its overview to preserve external references.
3. **Coding-guidelines `imported/` folder** (`spec/02-coding-guidelines/imported/`) — review the two migrated files (`00-testing-index.md`, `dry-refactoring-summary.md`) for whether they should be promoted into the canonical numbering or remain referenced from the imported subfolder.

---

## 8. Cross-References

- Master spec index: [`/spec/00-overview.md`](../00-overview.md)
- Root consistency report: [`/spec/99-consistency-report.md`](../99-consistency-report.md)
- Spec authoring guide: [`/spec/01-spec-authoring-guide/`](../01-spec-authoring-guide/00-overview.md)
- Migration record: [`/spec/99-archive/governance-history/2026-04-22-reorganization-plan.md`](../99-archive/governance-history/2026-04-22-reorganization-plan.md)
- Live phase tracker: `.lovable/spec-reorganization-plan-2026-04-22.md`
- Memory layout doc: `.lovable/memory/architecture/spec-tree-v3-2-0-layout.md`

---

## 9. Sign-Off

✅ **Reorganization complete.** The `spec/` tree now matches Spec Authoring Guide v3.2.0. All historical content is preserved in `99-archive/`. All cross-references repo-wide point to the new canonical paths.
