# C23 — Timezone Mention Consistency
**Version:** 0.1.0
**Updated:** 2026-06-02
**Severity:** None — but volume is high enough to extract
**Files affected:** 55 files mention timezone-related strings
---
## Evidence
```
$ grep -rln 'the user's local timezone\|UTC\|GMT\|local time' --include='*.md' spec/21-app/05-prompts | wc -l
55
```
Spot-check shows the overwhelming majority use `the user's local timezone` (per core memory rule). The volume — **55 files** — suggests boilerplate that could be **factored into one canonical section** and `→ see` from each doc.
## Why this matters
If the project ever changes timezone policy, 55 files need editing. Single source-of-truth would make that a 1-file change.
## Fix outline
1. Create `spec/21-app/05-prompts/conventions.md` (or amend existing root overview) with a single "Timezone" section.
2. Replace the 55 in-file mentions with a 1-line reference: `> Timestamps in **the user's local timezone** — see [conventions](…).`
## Atomic sub-tasks
1 conventions doc + 5 batch sweeps of ~11 files = 6 fix tasks.
## Sub-issue C23a — Inconsistent spelling
Sample shows `the user's local timezone` (per memory) is used; need to confirm none use `Asia/local timezone` or `KL`. Defer to fix-pass full grep.
