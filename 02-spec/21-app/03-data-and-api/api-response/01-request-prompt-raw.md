 Okay, so here the most, uh, important challenge is how to find the bearer token from the, uh, from the JavaScript itself without knowing it. So is it possible to get it from the header, uh, of the website that we are currently in? Because when we are making the request, we already logged in, so it should have the bearer token, just like I have shared. So what is the technique of getting the bearer token, uh, if we are logged in? So I have given the response, uh, that you are going to get, and where you have to make the request, uh, things like that, I have attached it to this. If you have any question and concern, let-

Update the spec.md to document the MacroLoop module's injection change (now uses shared InjectJS instead of custom Ctrl+A paste).

 Uh, hi there. In the combo change, I wanted to add a little bit more, uh, features. Uh, first, analyze that if this is hard to make, but if not, let's try to make it. So, um, when we, uh, make the combo, that's fine, it should be there. We can add, uh, one or two more buttons, uh, to it, and that button will do a little bit more stuff. Um, and ca- can we make this, uh, this item, this, uh, controller on a fixed state, uh, probably last to the, uh, body ending? Can we do that? Uh, is it possible? Is it going to be good or bad? And keep it always floating on the right side, top-- I mean, top right side of the, uh, screen. And next, uh, we have a Plans and Credit button. Okay? If we can, uh, click on this, and after clicking on this, we can actually find a free progress bar. And free progress bar XPath, I have also shared, and from there, we can just mark in the controller that free tier is available. Okay? And also, the total number of credits, it's usually written with quotations and things like that, so you could just do a inner text or things like that. So you will have a full text, like how many credits are available, and you can put it in the controller so that I could see the status. And there could be a Status button, uh, probably with Control+Alt+S, something like this, from the HTML accessibility, not from the AKH. AKH will have no control, uh, or will not progress with it. So if we only click on the Status button or do the Control+Alt+S from the HTML, it will do this. So first, it will click on the Plans and Credit, then check the, uh, free progress bar. So it needs to wait for like... to see if the, uh, total credit is visible, because if the total credit is visible, the others are visible. Um, then it will check if the free progress bar is there, and then get the information from the total credits and update in the controller in the UI so that I can know what's the status of it. And I have one other question: Can we do this without even visiting the, uh, XPath? Is there any way that it is possible to gain this? Okay, so this is, uh, my idea. Let me- know
