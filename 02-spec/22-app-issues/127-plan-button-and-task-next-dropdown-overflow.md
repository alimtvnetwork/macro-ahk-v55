# Issue 127 — Prompts dropdown: missing Plan entry + Task Next dropdown opens left and overflows

**Status:** Queued
**Reporter:** User (screenshot 2026-05-30, clarification 2026-05-30)
**Target version:** v3.38.0 (bundled with Issues 124/125/126)
**Owner module:** `standalone-scripts/macro-controller/src/ui/` — `prompt-dropdown.ts`, `task-next-ui.ts`, `plan-task-ui.ts`

> **Scope clarification (from user 2026-05-30):**
> This issue is ENTIRELY about the **extension's Prompts button dropdown** — the popover that opens when the user clicks the blue **Prompts** pill we inject into Lovable's composer. It is NOT about Lovable's native composer Plan-mode button. Do not touch any native Lovable buttons.

## 1. What the Prompts dropdown should look like

When the user clicks the **Prompts** pill, a popover opens with two primary entries (and the existing prompt list / save controls):

```
┌─ Prompts dropdown ──────────────────┐
│  ⏭  Task Next        ▸              │  ← opens submenu to the RIGHT
│  📋  Plan            ▸              │  ← opens submenu to the RIGHT
│  ─────────────────────              │
│  (existing prompt list / save row)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Both **Task Next** and **Plan** are rows inside the Prompts dropdown. Hovering or clicking either one opens its sub-menu **to the right** of the Prompts dropdown (never to the left, never clipped).

---

## 2. Two concrete bugs to fix

### Bug A — `Plan` row is missing from the Prompts dropdown

The Plan sub-menu logic already exists in `src/ui/plan-task-ui.ts` (156 lines) and a test fixture exists at `src/__tests__/plan-task-ui.test.ts`, but the **entry point row inside `prompt-dropdown.ts` is no longer rendered** (regression — it used to be there).

**Fix:** Re-add the `Plan` row to the Prompts dropdown body, immediately below `Task Next`, with the same row styling. Wire its click/hover to the existing `openPlanTaskMenu()` (or equivalent exported function) in `plan-task-ui.ts`. If that function does not exist, expose it.

The Plan sub-menu's contents/behavior are defined by the existing `plan-task-ui.ts` module and its test — **do not redesign them**; only re-attach the entry row.

### Bug B — `Task Next` sub-menu opens leftward and gets clipped

Screenshot shows the **Task Next** sub-menu (Next 1/2/3/5/7/10/12/15/20/30/40 + Custom + Settings) anchored to the **left** of the Prompts dropdown, with its left edge cut off by the viewport at ≤ ~1043 px width.

**Fix:** Sub-menu must open **to the right** of the Prompts dropdown by default. If right-side space < menu width, fall back to opening downward (stacked under the row) — never leftward off-screen. Use the same anchoring approach the codebase already uses for other right-flank popovers (see `__tests__/tasks-right-anchor.test.ts` and `__tests__/tasks-toggle-hover-open.test.ts` — these tests already encode the right-anchor contract; Task Next is violating it).

Apply the same right-anchor rule to the **Plan** sub-menu so both are consistent.

---

## 3. Acceptance criteria

1. Clicking the **Prompts** pill shows both `Task Next` and `Plan` rows inside the dropdown.
2. Hover/click on `Task Next` opens its sub-menu to the right; all entries (Next 1 task … Next 40 tasks, Custom, Settings) are fully visible on a 1043 × 757 viewport.
3. Hover/click on `Plan` opens the existing Plan sub-menu (behavior unchanged from `plan-task-ui.ts`) — also to the right, fully visible.
4. Existing tests still pass: `tasks-right-anchor.test.ts`, `tasks-toggle-hover-open.test.ts`, `plan-task-ui.test.ts`, `prompts-panel-layout.test.ts`.
5. New test asserts the Plan row is rendered inside `prompt-dropdown.ts` output and that clicking it invokes the Plan sub-menu opener.
6. New test asserts Task Next sub-menu's computed `left` is `>= anchorRect.right` (i.e. opens rightward) on a 1043-px viewport when the Prompts pill is in the left half of the screen.

## 4. Files to touch

```
standalone-scripts/macro-controller/src/ui/
├── prompt-dropdown.ts          # Re-add Plan row; ensure both rows are wired
├── task-next-ui.ts             # Fix anchor calc to open RIGHT (not left)
├── plan-task-ui.ts             # Same right-anchor rule; export opener if needed
└── __tests__/
    ├── plan-row-in-prompts-dropdown.test.ts   # NEW
    └── task-next-right-anchor.test.ts         # NEW (or extend tasks-right-anchor)
```

Plus version bump in the queued v3.38.0 (with Issues 124/125/126).

## 5. Five-step task plan

1. **Repro + locate regression** — Read `prompt-dropdown.ts`, `task-next-ui.ts`, `plan-task-ui.ts`, and the existing `tasks-right-anchor` / `plan-task-ui` tests. Identify exactly where the Plan row was removed and where Task Next's anchor calc went wrong. Document the diff in a short comment block at the top of the spec (§6 below, leave a Findings stub).
2. **Bug B fix — Task Next right-anchor** — Update `task-next-ui.ts` so the sub-menu's `left = anchorRect.right + GAP` by default, falls back to stacked-below when right space is insufficient. Add `task-next-right-anchor.test.ts` covering both cases. Confirm `tasks-right-anchor.test.ts` still passes.
3. **Bug A fix — Re-add Plan row** — In `prompt-dropdown.ts`, render a Plan row directly below the Task Next row using the same row component/styling. Wire its `click`/`pointerenter` to the Plan sub-menu opener from `plan-task-ui.ts` (export it if missing). Apply the same right-anchor logic so the Plan sub-menu also opens rightward.
4. **Tests + regression sweep** — Add `plan-row-in-prompts-dropdown.test.ts` (asserts row exists, has correct label/icon, opener fires). Run the full test suite; fix any fallout. Visual sanity check via screenshot at 1043 × 757.
5. **Version bump + changelog** — Roll into v3.38.0 with entries: "Restored missing Plan row in Prompts dropdown", "Fixed Task Next sub-menu opening leftward and clipping at narrow viewports".

## 6. Findings (Task 1 — 2026-05-30)

### F-1 — Plan row regression: moved off the dropdown body into a floating right-anchored panel

`renderPlanTaskSubmenu()` is still called, but **not** as a direct row inside the prompts dropdown column. In `prompt-dropdown.ts` `_appendHeaderAndSubmenu()` (L240–277), both `renderTaskNextSubmenu()` and `renderPlanTaskSubmenu()` are appended into a separately created `tasksGroup` `<div>` that is `position:absolute; top:0; left:100%; width:260px; display:none`. The `tasksGroup` is opened only via the `🎯 Tasks ▾` toggle button built in `buildTasksToggle()` (L117–172).

Consequence: from the user's point of view the Plan row is missing because it lives inside a separate floating panel they must first reveal — not as an inline row directly under Task Next inside the prompts dropdown body (which is what the issue's mockup §1 specifies). Tests `tasks-right-anchor.test.ts` and `tasks-toggle-hover-open.test.ts` encode the *current* floating-panel layout; the fix must additionally render Task Next + Plan as inline rows in the dropdown body (the floating panel can stay if desired, but the inline rows are the required UX).

Reference snippet (prompt-dropdown.ts L243–262):
```
const tasksGroup = document.createElement('div');
tasksGroup.setAttribute('data-tasks-anchor', 'right');
tasksGroup.style.cssText = 'display:none;position:absolute;top:0;left:100%; …width:260px; …';
renderTaskNextSubmenu(tasksGroup, ctx, taskNextDeps);
renderPlanTaskSubmenu(tasksGroup, ctx);          // ← Plan only reachable via toggle
container.appendChild(tasksGroup);
```

### F-2 — Task Next "opens left / clips" — root cause is the floating panel's lack of viewport-overflow guard

The actual Task Next sub-menu (`taskNextSub`, prompt-dropdown.ts L560–562) uses `position:static; margin:0 6px 6px 6px` — it stacks vertically inside the 260 px `tasksGroup`. There is no horizontal anchor calculation that could "open left" on its own.

The visual "opens left and is clipped" symptom comes one level up: when the Prompts pill sits in the right half of the viewport, the parent prompts dropdown ends near the viewport's right edge, and `tasksGroup`'s `left:100%; margin-left:6px; width:260px` pushes the entire Task Next + Plan panel past `window.innerWidth`. The browser then clips it on the right; the visible remnant appears flush-left against the prompts dropdown, which the user described as "opens left and clips". At a 1043 × 757 viewport with the pill in the right half, ~80–120 px of the panel is off-screen.

There is no `Math.min(spaceRight, 0)` flip-to-left/flip-to-below fallback in the current code. `keepTaskNextSubInView()` (L52–65) only handles vertical scrolling — no horizontal overflow.

### F-3 — Fix direction for Task 2 / Task 3

1. Render Task Next row + Plan row inline in the prompts dropdown body (directly under the dropdown header), in the order shown in §1. This satisfies Bug A and matches user-visible expectation.
2. When each row's sub-menu opens, compute `anchorRect = row.getBoundingClientRect()` and the menu's natural width. Default position: `left = anchorRect.right + GAP` (open rightward). Fallback: if `left + menuWidth > window.innerWidth - PAD`, stack the sub-menu below the row instead (`position:static; display:block`). Never open leftward off-screen.
3. Keep the existing `tasksGroup` floating panel and its tests intact for backward-compatibility, or remove it once the inline rows are confirmed; the spec leaves this open — Task 3 should pick the lighter option (inline only, drop floating panel) to avoid two parallel UIs.

### F-4 — Tests inventory

- `tasks-right-anchor.test.ts` — source-level assertions on the current floating-panel attributes; must be updated to match whichever layout Task 3 picks (or kept untouched if floating panel remains).
- `tasks-toggle-hover-open.test.ts` — same.
- `plan-task-ui.test.ts` — exercises `renderPlanTaskSubmenu` internals; unaffected by re-anchoring.
- `prompts-panel-layout.test.ts` — checks header/composition; unaffected unless we re-order header children.
- New tests required: `plan-row-in-prompts-dropdown.test.ts`, `task-next-right-anchor.test.ts` (or extend `tasks-right-anchor.test.ts`).

## 7. Non-goals

- Do **NOT** touch Lovable's native composer Plan-mode button or any native composer DOM.
- Do **NOT** redesign the Task Next or Plan sub-menu contents — only their anchoring and the missing entry row.
- Do **NOT** add a new global "mode selector" — the previous spec draft misread the request; that idea is withdrawn.
