# Issue 42: Macro Controller Button Bar Alignment, Cookie Auth & About Button

**Version**: v7.32
**Date**: 2026-03-18
**Status**: Done

---

## Issue Summary

### What happened

Multiple UX and functional issues in the macro controller's top button bar:

1. **Button height inconsistency** — Check and Play/Stop buttons had different heights, making the bar look uneven.
2. **No direct "Read Session Cookie" action** — When the bearer token expired or failed (401/403), the user had no manual way to refresh the token from the browser session cookie without re-injecting.
3. **About button not in top bar** — The About modal (author info + version) was only accessible by clicking the version badge, which was not discoverable.
4. **Token fallback on credit failure** — Needed verification that 401/403 on credit API automatically falls back to session cookie.

### Where it happened

- **Component**: `standalone-scripts/macro-controller/macro-looping.js` — injected macro controller overlay UI
- **Section**: Top button row (`btnRow`) containing Check, Play/Stop, Credits, Prompts, and Menu buttons

### Symptoms and impact

- Play/Stop button visually taller than other buttons due to `padding:4px 12px` vs `padding:5px 10px`.
- No gap consistency — buttons used `4px` gap with no group-level padding.
- Users couldn't manually refresh the auth token without re-injecting the entire script.
- About info was hidden behind an undiscoverable version badge click.

### How it was discovered

User report during manual usage of the macro controller.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Button height inconsistency

- **Cause**: Each button had ad-hoc inline styles with different padding values. The Play/Stop button used `padding:4px 12px` and `font-size:14px` while others used `padding:5px 10px` and `font-size:11px`. No shared height constraint.
- **Fix**: Added `height:28px;display:inline-flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;box-sizing:border-box;line-height:1;` to the shared `btnStyle` variable. Normalized all button paddings to `5px Xpx`. Changed button row gap from `4px` to `6px` and added `padding:5px 0` for group-level vertical breathing room.

### Token fallback verification

- **Finding**: Already implemented correctly at lines 842-849 of `macro-looping.js`. On 401/403 response from credit API:
  1. Calls `markBearerTokenExpired()` to log the expiry.
  2. Calls `invalidateSessionBridgeKey(token)` to remove the failing key from localStorage.
  3. Calls `fetchLoopCredits(true)` to retry — `resolveToken()` automatically iterates through remaining localStorage keys (`marco_bearer_token`, `lovable-session-id`, `ahk_bearer_token`) then falls back to reading the `lovable-session-id.id` cookie via `getBearerTokenFromCookie()`.
- **Status**: No code change needed — already working as designed.

### Read Session Cookie button

- **Cause**: No UI affordance existed for the user to manually trigger a cookie-to-localStorage refresh.
- **Fix**: Added `🍪 Read Cookie` button to the top bar. On click:
  1. Calls `getBearerTokenFromCookie()` to read `lovable-session-id.id` from `document.cookie`.
  2. If found, saves to `localStorage['marco_bearer_token']` and shows success toast.
  3. If not found, shows warning toast instructing user to log in.
  4. Button text temporarily changes to `✅ Saved` or `❌ Not found` for 2 seconds as feedback.

### About button

- **Cause**: The About modal was only triggered by clicking the version badge text — not discoverable.
- **Fix**: Added `ℹ️ About` button to the top bar that calls the existing `showAboutModal()` function. The modal shows author info (Md-Alim Ul Karim, CEO Riseup Asia), links, and controller version.

## Changes Made

### File: `standalone-scripts/macro-controller/macro-looping.js`

| Area | Change |
|------|--------|
| `btnStyle` (shared) | Added `height:28px;display:inline-flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;box-sizing:border-box;line-height:1;` |
| `btnRow` | Changed gap `4px` → `6px`, added `padding:5px 0` |
| Play/Stop button | Changed `padding:4px 12px` → `padding:5px 12px` |
| Menu button | Changed `padding:4px 10px` → `padding:5px 10px` |
| New: `sessionCookieBtn` | `🍪 Read Session Cookie` — reads cookie, saves to localStorage (in ☰ menu) |
| New: `aboutBtn` | `ℹ️ About` — opens About modal (in ☰ menu) |
| Button row assembly | Order: `Check | ▶/⏹ | Credits | Prompts | ☰` |

## Final Button Bar Layout

**Top bar (always visible):**
```
[ ☑ Check ] [ ▶ ] [ 💰 Credits ] [ 📋 Prompts ] [ ☰ ]
```

**Inside ☰ menu (secondary actions):**
- ▲ Loop Up / ▼ Loop Down
- ⏫ Force Move Up / ⏬ Force Move Down
- 📋 Export CSV / 📥 Download Bundle / 📋 Copy JS Bundle
- 🔧 Diagnostic Dump
- 🔴/🟢 Auth Panel
- 🍪 Read Session Cookie *(moved from top bar)*
- ℹ️ About *(moved from top bar)*

All top-bar buttons share:
- Fixed height: `28px`
- Consistent vertical centering via `display:inline-flex;align-items:center`
- Group padding: `5px` top and bottom
- Gap between buttons: `6px`
