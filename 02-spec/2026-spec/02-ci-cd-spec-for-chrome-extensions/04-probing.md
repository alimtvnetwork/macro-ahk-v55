# 04 — Probing Feature

> Cross-repo sibling probing rules and a runnable example.

Part of [`spec/2026-spec/02-ci-cd-spec-for-chrome-extensions/`](./readme.md).

## §4. Probing feature

*Probing* = parallel HEAD requests to discover sibling repos or assets without
downloading them.

- Use cases: detect highest-version sibling repo (`project-v2`, `project-v3`);
  verify all expected assets exist on a release page before publishing.
- Defaults: depth ≤ 20, parallelism ≤ 8, wall-clock cap 5 s.
- Implementation: `curl -I -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"` (bash) or
  `Invoke-WebRequest -Method Head` (PowerShell).
- **Never** retry on failure — sequential fail-fast.


---

## §20. Probing feature (full example)

```bash

# probe-siblings.sh — find the highest-numbered sibling repo (project-v2, -v3 …)
probe_max=20; concurrency=8; deadline=5
base="$1"  # e.g. https://github.com/acme/project
seq 2 "$probe_max" | xargs -P "$concurrency" -I{} -t bash -c '
  url="'"$base"'-v{}"
  code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -m '"$deadline"' "$url")
  [[ "$code" == "200" ]] && echo "{}"
' | sort -n | tail -1
```

The same algorithm is used during release publication to verify every required
asset URL returns `200` before flipping `draft: false`.

## Acceptance

- [ ] The implementation satisfies the `04 — Probing Feature` contract in this file and the folder-level acceptance target: Chrome-extension CI/CD, installer, release, operations, and audit contracts remain enforceable.
- [ ] Verification passes when `npm run test:cicd-spec` passes, and `node scripts/audit/check-acceptance.mjs --root=spec/2026-spec` reports this file has a machine-checkable acceptance contract.

Numeric defaults referenced in this file are canonical in [Runtime Defaults](../01-prompt-spec/reference/05-runtime-defaults.md). If a value differs, the SOT wins.

<!-- audit: determinism+pitfalls footer -->

## Determinism (MUST)

- **MUST** bind every CI numeric (timeouts, retries=0, artefact retention days, matrix size, job concurrency) to a named constant in `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md` or repo-level workflow constants. No inline literals in workflow YAML or scripts.
- **MUST** keep `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on bare `on: push:` — no `branches:` or `paths:` filters (see `mem://constraints/ci-push-trigger-unfiltered`). Canary: `ping.yml`. Regression test: `scripts/__tests__/ci-workflow-trigger-policy.test.mjs`.
- **MUST** sign release tags with the project key and embed `version.json` provenance (commit SHA + build epoch) into every uploaded artefact. Unsigned or unstamped releases are rejected by `audit-releases.yml`.
- **MUST** route every CI failure through `Logger.error` + workflow `::error::` annotation — never silent `continue-on-error: true` and never email/Slack/webhook notifications (see `mem://constraints/no-ci-notifications`).

## Pitfalls / Counter-examples

- ❌ Adding `branches: [main]` to `ci.yml` to "speed things up" — silently skips Lovable branch commits; regression has recurred 3× (see canary `ping.yml`). ✅ Keep `on: push:` bare; filter inside jobs with `if:` only.
- ❌ `continue-on-error: true` on the three audit scripts (`check-acceptance`, `check-dangling-links`, `check-must-constants`). ✅ Hard-gate them now that baseline is zero failures.
- ❌ Out-of-band tag creation via the GitHub UI — bypasses `release.yml` and produces an empty release page (`cicd-issues/03`, `05`, `06`). ✅ Use `gh release create` with the workflow dispatch path or rely on the release-watcher self-heal (`mem://cicd/release-watcher-self-heal-tag`).
- ❌ Retrying a failed publish step with exponential backoff. ✅ Fail fast per `mem://constraints/no-retry-policy`; surface the failure in the release page and require a human decision.
- ❌ Committing zipped extension artefacts to the repo. ✅ Build in CI, attach to the GitHub Release only (see `11-no-committed-zips.md`).

## Audit Anchors (source-of-truth)

- Implementations MUST honor every numeric default declared in [runtime defaults](../01-prompt-spec/reference/05-runtime-defaults.md); see also [related](readme.md).
- Runtime-default values MUST be read from named constants in `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md`, not copied into prose examples.
- Any deviation MUST raise a spec issue before code is shipped (`60 s` review window minimum).
