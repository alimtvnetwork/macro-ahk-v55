## All dangling links

_None detected by relative-path resolution._

## Recommended remediation pattern

1. Add or preserve `## Pitfalls` with counter-examples in every contract file.
2. Convert vague prose into MUST/SHALL rules and bind operational numbers to `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md` or `mem://` rules.
3. Keep README/overview files above 80 words with file maps and owner links.
4. Keep `node scripts/audit/check-acceptance.mjs`, `node scripts/audit/check-dangling-links.mjs`, `node scripts/audit/check-must-constants.mjs`, and `node scripts/audit/check-pitfalls.mjs` green.

## Heuristic transparency

Scores are computed by `scripts/audit/audit-scan.py` using regex heuristics; they are a screen, not a substitute for human review.
