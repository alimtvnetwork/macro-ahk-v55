# Blind-AI Smoke Test — 20 Questions

**Updated:** 2026-06-03
**Pass criterion:** 20 / 20. Each question must be answerable by pointing to a single spec file (no inference).

| # | Question | Authoritative file |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | What fields does a `Prompt` have? | `02-data-model/01-prompt.md` + `schemas/01-prompt.schema.json` |
| 2 | How is a Prompt `id` generated? | `02-data-model/04-id-and-slug-rules.md` |
| 3 | What is the canonical store interface? | `02-data-model/03-store-interface.md` |
| 4 | Where do source files live on disk? | `03-prompt-source-format/01-folder-layout.md` |
| 5 | What keys are required in `info.json`? | `schemas/05-info-json.schema.json` |
| 6 | What does the Loader return on parse failure? | `04-loader-contract/04-error-modes.md` |
| 7 | How are `${Variables}` resolved? | `04-loader-contract/03-variable-resolution.md` |
| 8 | What opens the dropdown? | `05-ui-contract/01-trigger.md` |
| 9 | What keys navigate the dropdown? | `ui-reference/01-keyboard-map.md` |
| 10 | What ARIA roles does the dropdown use? | `ui-reference/02-a11y-matrix.md` |
| 11 | How are paste targets resolved? | `06-injection-contract/01-target-resolution.md` |
| 12 | List the 4 paste strategies. | `06-injection-contract/02-paste-strategies.md` |
| 13 | How is paste success verified? | `06-injection-contract/04-paste-verification.md` |
| 14 | Which adapter handles Monaco/Lexical/ProseMirror? | `07-editor-adapters/04-rich-editors.md` |
| 15 | Where is the queue task schema? | `schemas/03-queue-task.schema.json` |
| 16 | What is the default inter-task delay? | `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md` |
| 17 | List the closed failure reason codes. | `reference/02-failure-reason-codes.md` |
| 18 | What fields must every failure log carry? | `13-failure-handling/05-mandatory-failure-log.md` |
| 19 | Which events are emitted at task completion? | `16-observability/02-event-schema.md` |
| 20 | What gates must CI run before merge? | `test-inventory/05-ci-gates.md` |

A blind AI that answers all 20 with a single direct file pointer can ship.

## Determinism (MUST)

- **MUST** bind every numeric default (timeouts, capacities, retries=0, debounce/throttle ms, char limits) to a named constant in `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md`. Inline literals are rejected by `check-must-constants.mjs`.
- **MUST** classify every failure with a stable `Reason` (see `reference/02-failure-reason-codes.md`) plus `ReasonDetail`, and log via `Logger.error` — never `console.error`, never silent `catch {}`.
- **MUST** include `SelectorAttempts[]` on every selector miss and `VariableContext[]` on every variable/data failure; unknown fields written as `null` with a reason.
- **MUST** render timestamps in the user-local timezone (`Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`); storage is UTC ms only.

## Pitfalls / Counter-examples

- ❌ Empty `catch (e) {}` — rejected by `public/error-swallow-audit.json`. ✅ `Logger.error` + re-throw.
- ❌ Retrying a failed call with exponential backoff. ✅ Fail fast per `mem://constraints/no-retry-policy`.
- ❌ Hardcoded `Asia/Kuala_Lumpur` (or any zone). ✅ User-local timezone at render time.
- ❌ `setInterval` / `setTimeout` without paired teardown. ✅ Register `pagehide` cleanup (see `mem://standards/timer-and-observer-teardown`).
- ❌ Magic numbers (`1500`, `64`) inline. ✅ Import the named constant from `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md`.

## Numeric Bounds (source-of-truth)

- Default operation budget MUST be **5000 ms** (per `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md`).
- Maximum retry attempts MUST be **3 items** before escalation.
- See [folder index](readme.md) for sibling specs and cross-references.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Every sibling `*.md` listed below this index also declares its own `## Acceptance` block (verified by `scripts/audit/check-acceptance.mjs`).
- [ ] All relative links in this file resolve (verified by `scripts/audit/check-dangling-links.mjs`).
- [ ] No operational numeric constant is hardcoded here without binding to `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md` (verified by `scripts/audit/check-must-constants.mjs --strict`).
- [ ] Composite audit score for this folder is `100 / 100` (verified by `scripts/audit/audit-scan.py`).
