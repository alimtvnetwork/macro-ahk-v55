# Empty States

| Surface | Trigger | Copy | Primary action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dropdown | No prompts loaded | "No prompts yet. Add one to get started." | "Create prompt" → opens editor |
| Dropdown | Filter matches none | "No prompts match \"{query}\"" | "Clear filter" |
| Queue panel | No tasks | "Queue is empty. Pick a prompt to enqueue." | "Open picker" |
| Plan-mode | No plan generated | "Plan will appear here after you run a prompt." | "Run prompt" |
| Settings → Host overrides | None configured | "No host overrides. Defaults apply everywhere." | "Add override" |
| Onboarding step 1 | First run | "Welcome — type `/` in any input to begin." | "Show tour" |

All empty states use the same `<EmptyState illustration label cta>` component to guarantee visual + a11y consistency.

## Acceptance

- [ ] The implementation satisfies the `Empty States` contract in this file and the folder-level acceptance target: the prompt feature spec remains internally linked and blind-AI implementable.
- [ ] Verification passes when `node scripts/audit/check-dangling-links.mjs` passes, and `node scripts/audit/check-acceptance.mjs --root=spec/2026-spec` reports this file has a machine-checkable acceptance contract.

## Determinism Notes

- This spec MUST be implemented exactly as written; any divergence MUST raise a spec issue first.
- Numeric defaults (timeouts, retries, sizes) MUST be sourced from `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md`; prose MUST cite constant names, not duplicate numeric values.
- All boolean toggles MUST have an explicit default of `false` unless the runtime-defaults table specifies otherwise.
- Implementations MUST treat undocumented states as a hard error and SHALL log via the namespace logger.

## Pitfalls

- **Anti-pattern:** silently swallowing errors with empty `catch {}` — every failure MUST go through `Logger.error()` with `Reason` + `ReasonDetail`.
- **Edge case:** new-tab / blank navigations (`about:blank`, `chrome://newtab/`) — gate every entry point with `isNewTabOrBlankUrl()`.
- **Counter-example:** hardcoding a timezone string (e.g. `Asia/Kuala_Lumpur`) — always render in the user's local timezone via `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`.
- **Gotcha:** assuming Chrome `storage.local` is synchronous — it is async and MUST be awaited; never read it during top-level module evaluation.

## Audit Anchors (source-of-truth)

- Implementations MUST honor every numeric default declared in [runtime defaults](../reference/05-runtime-defaults.md); see also [related](../readme.md).
- Runtime-default values MUST be read from named constants in `reference/05-runtime-defaults.md`, not copied into prose examples.
- Any deviation MUST raise a spec issue before code is shipped (`60 s` review window minimum).
